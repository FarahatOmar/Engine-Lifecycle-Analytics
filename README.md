# Engine Lifecycle Analytics & Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
This project demonstrates a predictive maintenance pipeline for industrial engines using sensor time-series data. The goal is to forecast **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** to enable proactive maintenance and reduce downtime.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Preparation:** Collected, cleaned, and scaled multivariate sensor data for 100 engines.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built a Random Forest model to forecast engine failures.  
- **Insights & Visualization:** Identified critical sensors driving degradation and visualized predicted vs. true RUL for stakeholders.  
- **Performance:** Achieved **MAE: 24.9 cycles**, supporting actionable maintenance decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib for visualization  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- VS Code for development
